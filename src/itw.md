## What is a class? What is an object?

- level: 1
  Many people get confused by the difference between class and object. The difference is simple and conceptual. A class is a template for objects, it let's you creating objects. For example the class could be a factory and the objects the cars created by that factory, that can have different properties (colors, engine, ...).

```js
// Class
class Car {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color
    this.kmCounter = 0
  }
  drive(km) {
    this.kmCounter += km
  }
}

// Objects
let c1 = new Car('red')
let c2 = new Car('blue')

c1.drive(42)
c1.drive(50)

console.log(c1)
```

## What is CSS selector specificity? How to calculate the specificity?

- level: 1

- Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied by the browsers.
- Specificity is usually the reason why your CSS-rules donâ€™t apply to some elements, although you think they should.
- Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.
- If two selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins.
- There are four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given selector: inline styles, IDs, classes, attributes, and elements.
- You can understand specificity if you love Star Wars: CSS Specificity Wars.
- You can understand specificity if you love poker: CSS Specificity for Poker Players
- When selectors have an equal specificity value, the latest rule is the one that counts.
- When selectors have an unequal specificity value, the more specific rule is the one that counts.
- Rules with more specific selectors have a greater specificity.
- The last rule defined overrides any previous, conflicting rules.
- The embedded style sheet has a greater specificity than other rules.
- ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors.
- You should always try to use IDs to increase the specificity.
- A class selector beats any number of element selectors.
- The universal selector and inherited selectors have a specificity of 0, 0, 0, 0.
- You can calculate CSS specificity with CSS Specificity Calculator.
